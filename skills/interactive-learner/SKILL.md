# Interactive Learner

Create deeply researched, engaging, interactive courses on any topic. Lessons open in the browser with a mix of click-based exercises, open-ended challenges, real-world missions, and AI-evaluated responses. Every course is personalized, evidence-based, and a little adventurous.

## Workflow

### New course: Profile → Research → Curriculum → Session → Build → Debrief

#### 1. Profile the student (first time only)

Keep profiling fast and frictionless. The student wants to learn, not fill out forms.

**Rules:**

- **Prefer multiple-choice questions.** They're faster to answer and give you structured data. Use the agent's question tool with concrete options wherever possible.
- **Max 1 open-ended question at a time.** Never dump multiple open questions in one message.
- **Max 3-4 profiling questions total.** Infer the rest from context and conversation.
- **Start teaching quickly.** You can refine the profile during the first session based on how they perform.

**What to gather (in order of priority):**

1. Experience level with this topic (multiple-choice: none / some exposure / use it occasionally / use it daily)
2. Goal (multiple-choice: career / hobby / curiosity / specific task + optional free text)
3. Time per session (multiple-choice: ~10 min / ~20 min / ~30+ min)
4. Background — only if not obvious from context (one open question max, e.g. "What's your day job or main interest?")

Infer (don't ask): learning pace, jargon tolerance, visual vs text preference, analogies from their domain.

See [student-profiling.md](references/student-profiling.md) for the full profiling framework.

Initialize progress:

> All scripts use `uv run`. If `uv` is not available, use `python3` instead.

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/progress.py init <course> <name>
```

#### 2. Research the topic thoroughly

**This is critical. Do not skip or rush this step.** Before designing any curriculum, become an expert on the subject.

**Deep research protocol:**

1. **Search for authoritative, recent sources** — prioritize official documentation, peer-reviewed content, respected practitioners, and recent (2024-2026) material
2. **Find the best learning resources that already exist** — outstanding blog posts, interactive tutorials, YouTube channels, open-source tools, practice sandboxes, visualization tools, community forums
3. **Identify the conceptual structure** — what are the foundational concepts? What depends on what? What are the common misconceptions? What's the optimal learning order?
4. **Discover the "aha moments"** — what analogies, visualizations, or exercises make this topic click for people? What do the best teachers do differently?
5. **Collect real-world examples** — case studies, war stories, practical applications that make abstract concepts tangible
6. **Find hands-on resources** — playgrounds, sandboxes, tools the student can actually use during the course

**Save research notes** to a file the student can reference later:

```bash
# Write research to a markdown file alongside the course
# Include: key sources, recommended deep-dives, practice resources, community links
```

**Source priorities** (in order):

1. Official documentation and specs
2. Peer-reviewed research / reputable educational content
3. Respected practitioners and educators (conference talks, well-known blogs)
4. Community-vetted resources (highly-rated tutorials, curated awesome-lists)
5. Interactive tools and sandboxes

#### 3. Design the curriculum

Based on research, plan the full course:

- 8-12 sessions for a standard course (3-5 for quick intro, 12-20 for deep dive)
- Define learning objectives per session — what will the student be able to DO after each one?
- Map concept dependencies — what must come before what?
- Plan review touchpoints — which earlier concepts get revisited where?
- Identify sessions where real-world missions, external tools, or deeper exploration fit naturally
- Max 6 new vocabulary terms per session, each with a bridging analogy

Save the curriculum and show it to the student as an interactive dashboard:

1. Write a curriculum JSON file (array of session objects):
   ```json
   [
     {
       "session_number": 1,
       "title": "How Bash Actually Works",
       "description": "The mental model that changes everything",
       "objectives": ["Explain what a shell does", "Break down command syntax"],
       "concepts": ["shell-mental-model", "commands-and-arguments"],
       "estimated_minutes": 20
     }
   ]
   ```
2. Save it to the course progress:
   ```bash
   uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/progress.py set-curriculum <course> <curriculum.json>
   ```
3. Build and open the dashboard so the student can see the full plan:
   ```bash
   uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/build-dashboard.py --open
   ```

**STOP here.** Ask the student to review the curriculum in the dashboard. Let them react, reprioritize, or skip sessions they already know. Do not proceed to step 4 until the student confirms the plan.

See [course-design-guide.md](references/course-design-guide.md) for topic-type → component mapping and session patterns.

#### 4. Build the explainer

Build a lesson config using **only content components** (no scored exercises):

- **MANDATORY: Before generating JSON for ANY component, read its schema in [component-catalog.md](references/component-catalog.md). Do NOT guess field names. Every component has different required fields — using wrong field names produces empty/broken output that silently fails.**
- See [sharp-edges.md](references/sharp-edges.md) for anti-patterns to avoid
- Mix component types — no two consecutive sections of the same type
- Include at least one moment of surprise, delight, or creative challenge per session
- Keep JSON concise but rich: ~60-100 lines

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/build-lesson.py <explainer.json> --mode explainer --course <course-id> --open
```

Tell the student: "Check the explainer I created for you. Let me know when you've finished reading."

#### 5. Conversational checkpoint

When the student comes back after reading:

1. **Ask "Was everything clear?"** — discuss any confusion, clarify using your research sources. If the student has questions, answer them thoroughly and refer to the research notes.
2. **Ask 1 teach-back question in chat** — "Let me quickly check if you're ready for the test: [question about a key concept from the explainer]"
3. If the student struggles, explain further before proceeding. If they nail it, move to the test.

Open-ended assessment (explain-back, roleplay, open-reflection) happens here in conversation, not in HTML. The agent evaluates responses in real-time.

#### 6. Build the test

Build a test config using **only scored components** + `score-summary`:

- Include `quiz`, `matching`, `fill-blanks`, `sorting-game`, and/or `custom` components
- Always end with `score-summary`
- Keep JSON concise: ~40-80 lines

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/build-lesson.py <test.json> --mode test --course <course-id> --open
```

Tell the student to complete the test and click "Save my results" when done.

#### 7. Debrief after the session

After the student completes the test:

1. Student clicks "Save my results" — a JSON file downloads to `~/Downloads/<course>-session<N>-results.json`
2. Student tells the agent they're done
3. Agent reads the results JSON:
   ```bash
   cat ~/Downloads/<course>-session<N>-results.json
   ```
4. Update progress with scores AND concept mastery:
   ```bash
   uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/progress.py update <course> --session N --score S --max M --concepts '{"pod-basics": 0.9, "deployments": 0.6}'
   ```
   Assign concept scores based on your knowledge of which test questions tested which concepts.
5. Rebuild the dashboard:
   ```bash
   uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/build-dashboard.py --open
   ```
6. Discuss what they found hard or interesting
7. If they had a real-world mission: ask how it went, what they discovered
8. Prepare notes for the next session — adjust based on everything you learned

### Returning student: Review → Adapt → Build next session

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/progress.py show
```

Check:

- Concept mastery levels — which concepts need review? (below 0.7 = needs reinforcement)
- Time since last session — longer gap = more review needed
- Recent scores — adjust difficulty
- Open questions or missions from last session — follow up on these
- Achievements earned — acknowledge naturally

Generate the next session, weaving in review of weak concepts using varied component types (not just repeating the same quiz).

### Generate review session (when needed)

When concepts are fading or it's been a while:

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/progress.py review <course>
```

This outputs concepts due for review. Build a review session that mixes these concepts into fresh contexts and varied exercise types.

### View student dashboard

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/build-dashboard.py --open
```

Options: `--progress <path>` (custom progress file), `--output <path>` (custom output path).

## Lesson JSON Structure

Each session produces two JSON files: an **explainer** (content-only) and a **test** (scored exercises). Open-answer questions (explain-back, roleplay, open-reflection) are asked by the agent in conversation between the two phases.

### Explainer JSON (`--mode explainer`)

## Finding Videos

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/find-videos.py "topic for beginners"
```

> The video search script scrapes YouTube HTML and may break when YouTube changes their page structure. If it fails, ask the user to search YouTube manually and paste the URL.

Max 2 embedded videos per lesson. But you CAN recommend additional videos/resources via `recommended-deep-dive` components — these are optional extras, not required viewing.

## Core Rules

1. **Research first.** Never teach from assumptions. Find authoritative, recent sources.
2. **Bridge from known knowledge.** Read the student profile. Connect every new concept to something they already understand.
3. **Explain, then discuss, then test.** The explainer HTML teaches. The conversation checks understanding and fills gaps. The test HTML assesses. This flow is structurally enforced by `--mode explainer` and `--mode test`.
4. **Mostly click-based tests.** Test exercises should be click/drag/select. Open-ended assessment happens in conversation (Step 5), not in HTML.
5. **Conversational teach-back is powerful.** Use the checkpoint between explainer and test to ask 1 teach-back question, discuss confusion, and verify readiness. This replaces the old in-HTML open-answer textareas.
6. **Max 6 new terms per session.** Each needs an analogy bridging to what the student knows.
7. **50% practice, 30% content, 20% assessment** — but treat this as a guideline, not a straitjacket. Some sessions are exploration-heavy, some are drill-heavy.
8. **Vary components.** No two consecutive sections should be the same type.
9. **Always end tests with score-summary.**
10. **Be adventurous.** Send students to real websites, sandboxes, and tools. Recommend books, talks, and articles. Ask them to draw something and share it. Suggest they explain a concept to a friend. The lesson HTML is the core, but learning extends beyond it.
11. **Achievements are dynamic.** Don't use a fixed list. Generate achievements that match the specific course, topic, and student milestones. See [gamification.md](references/gamification.md).
12. **Every interaction earns data.** Track concept mastery, not just session scores. Feed this into future sessions.
