# Gamification System

## Philosophy

Gamification should serve learning, not replace it. Every game mechanic must map to an evidence-based learning principle. If it doesn't improve retention or understanding, cut it.

The 2025 meta-analysis found the most effective gamification combination is **Rules/Goals + Challenge + Mystery** — not points, badges, and leaderboards.

What works:
- Visible mastery progression (skill trees, concept maps that fill in)
- Meaningful achievements tied to actual understanding
- Narrative framing ("You're investigating X" rather than "Complete lesson 5")
- Learner agency ("Choose your next topic")
- Challenge that matches skill level (flow state)

What to avoid:
- Guilt-tripping ("You broke your streak!")
- Artificial scarcity
- XP inflation (grinding easy content for points)
- Loss aversion manipulation
- Achievements that reward completion without comprehension

## XP (Experience Points)

| Action | XP |
|--------|---:|
| Correct quiz answer | 10 |
| Correct match pair | 10 |
| Fill-in-the-blank slot correct | 15 |
| Sorting game correct | 15 |
| Custom challenge completed | 20 |
| Perfect session score | +25 bonus |
| Boss challenge cleared | 50 |
| Completed a real-world mission | 30 |
| Thoughtful explain-back (agent-evaluated) | 20 |

XP accumulates across sessions and courses. Display in nav bar.

## Levels

| Level | Title | XP Required |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Beginner | 0 |
| 2 | Explorer | 100 |
| 3 | Practitioner | 300 |
| 4 | Builder | 600 |
| 5 | Specialist | 1200 |
| 6 | Expert | 2500 |
| 7 | Master | 5000 |
| 8 | Grandmaster | 10000 |

Level up is announced naturally, not with fanfare unless it's a big milestone (5+).

## Achievements: Dynamic, Not Hardcoded

**Achievements should be generated by the agent for each specific course, topic, and student.** Do not use a fixed list of generic achievements.

### How it works

The agent calls `progress.py achieve` with a custom achievement when the student hits a meaningful milestone:

```bash
uv run .agents/skills/interactive-learner/scripts/progress.py achieve <course> <id> <icon> <name> <description>
```

### Examples by topic

**Kubernetes course:**
- 🫛 "Pod Whisperer" — "Correctly explained pod lifecycle in your own words"
- ☸️ "First Deployment" — "Successfully built a Deployment config from scratch"
- 🔥 "Incident Commander" — "Nailed the on-call roleplay scenario"
- 🌐 "Cluster Explorer" — "Completed your first real-world sandbox mission"
- 🐛 "Bug Hunter" — "Found 3 bugs in debug challenges"

**Design course:**
- 🎨 "Color Theorist" — "Mastered the color wheel concepts"
- 👁️ "Sharp Eye" — "Spotted all the design principle violations"
- ✏️ "First Sketch" — "Completed your first drawing mission"
- 🖼️ "Gallery Curator" — "Found and analyzed 3 real-world design examples"

**Language course:**
- 🗣️ "First Conversation" — "Completed a full roleplay dialogue"
- 📖 "Bookworm" — "Read your first article in the target language"
- 🎵 "Culture Explorer" — "Listened to music and identified vocabulary"

### Achievement design principles

1. **Celebrate understanding, not just completion** — "Explained X correctly" > "Finished lesson 5"
2. **Tie to specific course milestones** — unique to the topic being studied
3. **Include adventurous achievements** — for missions, creative challenges, social learning
4. **Surprise the student** — some achievements shouldn't be visible in advance
5. **Scale with difficulty** — early achievements are easy, later ones require real mastery
6. **Limit to ~10-15 per course** — each one should feel meaningful

## Streak Rules

- A "day" counts if any session is completed that calendar day
- Streak increments when sessions happen on consecutive days
- Missing a day resets to 1 (not 0 — they showed up today)
- Mention streak naturally ("Day 3 in a row!") but **never guilt-trip** about broken streaks
- If a streak breaks, acknowledge it gently and move on: "Welcome back! Let's pick up where we left off."

---

## Boss Challenges

At the end of each module (every 3-4 sessions), include a harder challenge that:
- Combines concepts from all sessions in the module
- Uses a more complex interaction (multi-step simulator, multi-part fill-blanks, or a roleplay scenario)
- Awards 50 XP
- Earns a topic-specific achievement on completion

## Concept Mastery Visualization (Future: Memory Garden)

The progress system tracks per-concept mastery with FSRS (spaced repetition). This enables:

- **Concept health indicators** — which concepts are strong vs fading
- **Targeted review** — the agent knows exactly what to revisit
- **Mastery progression** — visible growth over time

Future direction: A "memory garden" visualization where concepts are plants that grow with mastery and wilt when neglected. Wilting plants need watering (review). This replaces guilt-based streaks with a more humane, curiosity-driven motivation model.

## Score Display

Always end sessions with `score-summary` component showing:
- Points scored / max points
- Fun message based on percentage (but never shaming for low scores)
- XP earned this session
- Running XP total and level
- Any new achievements
- Pending missions (if any)
- Next session preview
